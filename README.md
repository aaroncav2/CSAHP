# Hierarchical Decision Model Advanced (HDMA)
This is a student PhD project at Portland State University to assess Cybersecurity Readiness for the Energy Industry using expert opinions in pairwise comparisons to enable validation of experts consistency through Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) eigenvectors.  
This tool helps organizations evaluate their need to enhance cyber security controls. The tool is most suited for situtations where an outage is taking place within the organization.  
Q: So what makes HDM not AHP?  
A: Constant sum scaling, adding an 11th criteria, unique measurement of consistency, and desirability calculations.  
HDM terminology Compared to AHP  
Levels - HDM, AHP  
Level 1 - Mission, Focus  
Level 2 - Perspective, Actors  
Level 3 - Criterion, Objectives  
Level 4 - Alternative, Scenario  
Constant sum scale in Excel  
1	0

5	0.66667  
6	1  
7	1.5  
8	2.33333  
9	4  
10	9  
What's new in the advanced version (aka HDMA) over the PSU tool?  
Density - a customizable baseline measurement to make account of outliers  
Focus charts - deep dive reference when debating one individual implementation over another  
Skip level comparisons (alternatives to perspectives)  
Note: that number of variables 4,5,6,7, and 11 have been put into the HDMA spreadsheet and tested. If you want to use variables matrices of 3, 8, 9, or 10 you will need to create that in the HDMA tool spreadsheet (work backwards from 11 and make space in the spreadsheet).
